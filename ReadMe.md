# **Math Expression Converter**

This C++ program is designed to read multiple math expressions from a file and convert them into prefix and postfix notation. It utilizes a binary expression tree to represent the expressions and follows object-oriented programming principles.

# **Through the development of this project, I gained expertise in:**

- Converting infix math expressions to postfix and using them to build expression trees
- Implementing and using a binary expression tree
- Implementing classes using templates

# **This program offers the following benefits:**
- Enhanced understanding of math expression representation and evaluation: By converting expressions to prefix and postfix notation and building expression trees, I gained a deeper understanding of how these expressions can be represented and evaluated.
- Improved problem-solving skills: Working with expression trees required me to think critically and creatively to find solutions to various challenges.
- Enhanced programming skills: Implementing classes using templates allowed me to practice and improve my object-oriented programming skills.

Overall, the Math Expression Converter is a valuable tool for improving my understanding of math expression representation and evaluation, as well as my programming skills. I believe it could be useful for others seeking to learn about these concepts as well.
